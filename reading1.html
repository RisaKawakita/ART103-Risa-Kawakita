            <h3>Question 1</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>What is a good working definition of what a System is and perhaps what it is not?</p>
            <p>
              A "system" is an organized collection of sub-elements that are interrelated and configured to achieve a certain purpose. 
              These sub-elements interact with each other and are coordinated to achieve a purpose as a whole. For example, a computer 
              system consists of elements such as hardware, software, data, and interfaces that people use.
              <br>
              <br>
              For a system to function properly, multiple elements must be well coordinated, coordinated with each other, 
              and work together effectively. To do this, it is important that each element has a clear purpose and clearly defined 
              roles and responsibilities. Also, the purpose of the system as a whole should be clear. This allows each element to understand 
              their role and work together to achieve their goals.
              <br>
              <br>
              On the other hand, if the system does not work properly, there will be a lack of harmony among the elements, preventing them 
              from cooperating to achieve their goals. Conflicts and confusion between elements can destabilize the entire system and prevent
               it from functioning properly.
            </p>
          
   
            <h3>Question 2</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p>For the 4 system definations you were to look up please give in your own words what they mean and give an example of them for each case.</p>
            <p>
              A system is a set of interconnected components that work together to achieve a specific function or goal. These components can be physical or abstract,
               and they interact with each other through inputs, processes, and outputs. Systems can be found in various fields, including engineering, science,
                management, and social sciences.
                <br>
                <br>
                A specific example of a system is a transportation system. A transportation system includes a network of roads, highways, railways, airports, and other infrastructure 
components that work together to transport people and goods from one place to another. The system involves multiple inputs, such as fuel, vehicles, and passengers,
 and processes, such as traffic control and logistics, to move these inputs efficiently and safely. The outputs of the transportation system are the delivery of
  people and goods to their intended destinations. The transportation system is an interconnected set of components that work together to achieve the function of
   moving people and goods.
            </p>
    
            <h3>Question 3</h3>
            <br>
            <br>
            <p> What is the difference between ideas of Modularity and Tesselation? What are the properties that are in oppostion with each other?</p>

            <p>
              Modularity and tessellation are both concepts related to the division and organization of space, but they differ in their fundamental properties.

              Modularity refers to the idea of dividing space into discrete, self-contained units or modules, which can be combined or rearranged in different ways
               to create different configurations. The units or modules are typically uniform in size and shape and are designed to fit together in a specific way.
                Modularity is often used in architecture, product design, and engineering, where it allows for efficient and flexible use of space and resources.
              <br>
              <br>
              Tessellation, on the other hand, refers to the process of covering a surface or plane with geometric shapes or tiles in a way that leaves no gaps 
              or overlaps. Tessellations are typically made up of repeating patterns or shapes, and can be seen in art, design, and mathematics. Unlike modular 
              systems, tessellations do not necessarily involve discrete units that can be rearranged or combined.
              <br>
              <br>
              The properties that are in opposition with each other between modularity and tessellation are flexibility versus uniformity. Modularity allows 
              for flexibility and variation in the arrangement of the modules, while tessellation requires uniformity in the shape and size of the tiles in
               order to create a repeating pattern with no gaps or overlaps. Modularity can result in a more dynamic and adaptable design, while tessellation 
               tends to create a more rigid and structured pattern.
</p>

<h3>Question 4</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p> What is the difference between designing something that has Complexity (aperiodic) vs being Uniform (periodic)</p>
<p>The main difference between designing something that has complexity (aperiodic) versus being uniform (periodic) is in the level of predictability and repetition of the design.

  A design with complexity, or aperiodic design, has a lack of predictable repetition and structure. This means that the design may have a lot of variation and irregularity, and it
   may be difficult to identify a repeating pattern. Examples of aperiodic designs can be seen in nature, such as the branching patterns of trees or the irregular shapes of 
   coastlines.
  On the other hand, a design that is uniform, or periodic, has a regular, repeating pattern. The design elements are typically identical or similar in shape and 
  size, and they are arranged in a predictable pattern. Examples of periodic designs include the repeating patterns of tiles or the honeycomb structure of beehives.
  <br>
  <br>
  When designing something with complexity, the designer often needs to consider how to balance the irregularity and variation of the design with the need for 
  coherence and structure. The challenge is to create a design that appears intentional and unified despite its lack of repetition and predictability.
  
  In contrast, when designing something uniform, the designer's focus is on creating a design that is consistent and predictable. The challenge is to create a 
  design that is visually appealing and interesting while maintaining the regularity of the pattern.
  
  Overall, the difference between complexity and uniformity in design lies in the predictability and repetition of the design elements, with complexity having
   more irregularity and variation, and uniformity having a regular and repeating pattern.</p>

<h3>Question 5</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>What is the difference between a system diagram and a some kind of feature diagram like a exploded view drawing or a illustration like this lady bug.
   Please explain in complete sentances.</p>
<p>A system diagram and a feature diagram, such as an exploded view drawing or an illustration like a ladybug, serve different purposes and have
   different levels of detail.

  A system diagram is a graphical representation of a complex system that shows the relationships between its components and how they work together.
   It provides an overview of the system and its structure, including inputs, outputs, processes, and feedback loops. System diagrams are commonly
    used in engineering, science, and management to help visualize and understand complex systems.
  <br>
  <br>
  In contrast, a feature diagram such as an exploded view drawing or an illustration like a ladybug is a detailed depiction of a specific part or 
  feature of a system. It shows the individual components of the feature and how they fit together, often in a 3D representation. These types of 
  diagrams are typically used in engineering and manufacturing to help understand the construction and assembly of a product.
  
  The main difference between a system diagram and a feature diagram is the level of detail and the focus of the diagram. A system diagram provides 
  a high-level view of the entire system and its components, while a feature diagram provides a detailed view of a specific feature or part of the system. 
  A system diagram is useful for understanding how the system works as a whole, while a feature diagram is useful for understanding the construction and 
  assembly of a specific part or feature of the system.</p>
